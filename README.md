# sudokucalc

This was created entirely by AGI Jr, using the following prompts (shown wth their replies) in this order.  With the exception
of the first request, each exchange is captured in single commit in the repo.

    me> Hi.  Please create a simple index.html file that references React from a CDN and for now just draws an empty sudoku board.
    jr> I have created the `index.html` file. It includes a simple Sudoku board rendered using React. The board is currently empty.

    me> When I open index.html the page is blank and I get the error "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'".  Please fix this.
    jr> I have updated the `index.html` file. The issue was that the browser was not understanding the JSX syntax used in the React code. I've added a reference to Babel, a JavaScript compiler that can convert JSX into regular JavaScript that the browser can understand. The script tag containing the React code now also specifies `type="text/babel"` to indicate that the code should be processed by Babel.

    me> Great, that fixed it.  Now please update it so that the borders around the outside and between the 3x3 boxes are thicker.
    jr> I have updated the `index.html` file. The borders around the outside and between the 3x3 boxes of the Sudoku board are now thicker. I achieved this by adding some CSS rules to style the cells and rows.

    me> Hmmm. Your code looks good to me but the page is blank again.  This time I don't get any erroors in the console.
    jr> have updated the `index.html` file. The issue was with the CSS rules. In CSS, we don't use quotes around the values of properties. I've removed the quotes and the page should now display correctly.

    me> Great, that fixed it.  Now please add a button labeled "Add a Cage" below the board.  Each time the button is clicked it should add an element to a list of boxes displayed to the right of the board so that the first one is labeled "Cage 1", the second "Cage 2", etc.  Each of the elements in the list should have an input area labelled "Sum" which allows entry of a numeric values from 1-81.
    jr> I have updated the `index.html` file. Now, there is a "Add a Cage" button below the Sudoku board. Each time the button is clicked, it adds an element to a list of cages displayed to the right of the board. Each cage is labeled "Cage 1", "Cage 2", etc. Each cage also has an input area labeled "Sum" which allows entry of numeric values from 1 to 81.

    me> Thanks, that was almost perfect, but please move the "Add a Cage" button to be below the board instead of beside it, and add a placeholder of "cage sum" to the input field in each cage box.
    jr> I have updated the `index.html` file. Now, the "Add a Cage" button is located below the Sudoku board. Each cage box also has an input field with a placeholder of "cage sum".

    me> Hmm, that's not quite right, that moved not only the button but also the list of cage boxes to all be below the board.  I'd like the "Add a Cage" button to be below the board, but the Cage boxes themselves to stay where they were to the right of the board.
    jr> I have updated the `index.html` file. Now, the "Add a Cage" button is located below the Sudoku board, and the list of cage boxes is displayed to the right of the board. Each cage box also has an input field with a placeholder of "cage sum".

    me> That looks great.  Now can you please draw a board around each of the cage inputs and keep track of the current selected cage input.  Whenever a cage input box is added it should become the currently selected cage input.   If the user clicks on a cage input box (outside the input field) it should become the currently selected cage input.  There should only be one currently selected cage input at a time. The currently selected cage input should have a light green background (and the non-selected cage inputs should stay white).

The currently selected cage input has a light green background, while the non-selected cage inputs have a white background.

    me> Great, now can you add a minimum width so that the full "cage sum" label is always visible?  Right now it's getting cut off at "cag".
    jr> I have updated the `index.html` file to include a minimum width for the cage input boxes. Now, the full "cage sum" label should always be visible and not get cut off.

    me> Hmm, that didn't work.  I think maybe it needs to be on the input field within the diiv?
    jr> I have updated the `index.html` file to include a minimum width for the input field within the cage input boxes. Now, the full "cage sum" label should always be visible and not get cut off.

    me> Ok, that worked.  Thanks.  Now can you make it so that when you click a cell in the sudoku board it adds it to the currently selected cage's list of cells.  The cells that are in the currently selected cage's list of cells should have a green background while that cage is selected.  Clicking a cell that is already in the currently selected cage's list of cells should remove it from that cage's list of cells.

Clicking a cell that is already in the currently selected cage's list of cells removes it from that cage's list of cells.

    me> Perfect.  Now please make the green for the selected cells lighter and give all the cells that are in non-selected cages a light gray background.  If the user adds a cell to the current cage that is already in another cage it should be red instead of green.

Now, the selected cells in the current cage will have a lighter green color, all the cells that are in non-selected cages will have a light gray background, and if a user adds a cell to the current cage that is already in another cage, it will be red instead of green.

    me> Perfect.  Now can you add a button below the "Add a Cage button" that says "Render board".  When the button is clicked, if there are cells that overlap between cages, pop up an alert that says "There are overlapping cells, please fix this before renderinig."  If there are no overlaps, then create another sudoku board to the right of the cage list which just renders all cells from all cages in gray.

    me> This is almost exactly what I wanted, but after rendering if I go back and change the cages on the left, the changes are immediately reflected in the board on the right.  My intention was that the board on the right would be disconnected from the original board on the left and would not update unless the user hits the Render button again.

    me> Previously you updated index.html to add a render button that renders a second board to the right of the first.  This was almost exactly what I wanted, but after rendering if I go back and change cages in the board on the left, the changes are immediately reflected in the board on the right.  My intention was that the board on the right would be disconnected from the original board on the left and would not update unless the user hits the Render button again.  Can you please update index.html accordingly?
    jr> I have updated the `index.html` file. Now, the board on the right will not update unless the user hits the Render button again.

    me> Hmm, I see the JSON.strinyify so that sure seems like it should work but the board on the right is still updating when I manipulate the one on the left.  Can you take another look?
    jr> I have updated the `index.html` file again. This time, I made a copy of the cages when the Render button is clicked and used this copy for rendering the board on the right. This should prevent the board on the right from updating when you manipulate the one on the left. Please check if it works as expected now.

    me> Great, that worked. Now I'd like you to make the board on the right a separate type of board that allows for toggling between three modes for each of the digits 1-9 in each cell.  The digits 1-9 should be printed in three rows in each cell, 1-3 on the first row, 4-6 on the second row and 7-9 on the third row. Initially all cells start in the 'Available' mode where they are rendered in green.  Clicking one of them will cycle it to 'Required' mode where that number turns blue and gets bold and all the other numbers are displayed in gray with strikethrough.  Clicking again will cycle it to to 'Forbidden' mode where it is displayed in red.  Clicking again will cycle back to available mode.

    me> Hmm, that's not quite right, it looks like you updated the board on the left.  That should remain the same and be the source for rendering the board on the right, but only the board on the right should have the digits in them and toggle through modes. Can you please fix it?

    me> Hmm, that's much better, but right now the digits in the board on the right all change modes together, they should each cylce through the individual states separately.
    *CRASH*

New session:

    me> In index.html, right now, the numbers in the box on the right all toggle through modes as a whole -- that is, they all go from Available to Required to Forbidden and back to Available and so on all together at once.  Instead they should each cycle separately. Can you please update index.html with the right changes to work this way?
    jr> I have updated the `index.html` file. Now, each number in the box on the right will cycle through modes separately.
    me> Hmm now the numbers on the right don't do anything when I click them.
